# Spotify

Created this project to get acquainted with creating a Node server, using axios, and developing a frontend application with ReactJS
<br />
Functionality: 
  <li>Sign into Spotify</li>
  <li>Retrieve user's playlists</li>
  <li>Display selected playlist in table</li>
  <li>Search for Tracks or Artists</li>
  <li>Selecting table row will display a popup that will allow user to play the selected song, or play songs from a selected artist</li>
<br />

<b> Note: This does not work if you clone and run this repository yourself. To must input a client_id and client_secret in server.js. </b>
<br />
